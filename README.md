Asset Marketplace
===============================


This is a decentralized asset marketplace smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows users to mint and trade various types of music assets, such as sounds, packs, elements, and tracks.

## Overview

The asset marketplace consists of the following main features:

## Minting Assets:

Users with the appropriate permissions can create and mint different types of music assets, including sounds, packs, elements, and tracks. Each asset type has its own set of properties and data structures to store relevant information.

## Asset Sales:

Users can offer their assets for sale at a specified price. Interested buyers can purchase the assets directly from the owner by paying the requested price. The marketplace takes a small cut from each transaction as a fee.

## Asset Auctions:

Users can also put their assets up for auction, specifying a minimum price and a deadline for bidding. During the auction period, interested buyers can place bids, and the highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the asset. If no bids are placed, the asset remains with the owner.


## Smart Contract Structure

The smart contract code is organized into multiple files:

1. AssetMinter.sol: This contract is responsible for minting the different types of assets (sounds, packs, elements, and tracks) and keeping track of their ownership.

2. AssetPurchaseProvider.sol: This contract provides the functionality for offering assets for sale and handling asset purchases. It also manages asset auctions.

3. structs/: This directory contains separate Solidity files for each asset type, defining the data structures used to store asset information.

## Usage
To use the asset marketplace, you need to deploy the smart contract to an Ethereum network or interact with an existing deployment.

### Mint Assets:
As the contract owner, you can create and mint different types of assets by calling the respective functions (createSoundAsset, createPackAsset, createElementAsset, createTrackAsset) in the AssetMinter contract. Provide the required asset details as function parameters.

### Offer Assets for Sale:
Once an asset is minted, you can offer it for sale by calling the offerAssetForSale function in the AssetPurchaseProvider contract. Specify the asset ID, requested price, and duration for which the asset should be available for sale.

### Purchase Assets:
Interested buyers can purchase assets that are offered for sale by calling the purchaseAsset function in the AssetPurchaseProvider contract. Provide the asset ID and send the requested price as ETH along with the transaction.

### Auction Assets:
To auction an asset, call the placeAssetInAuction function in the AssetPurchaseProvider contract. Specify the asset ID, minimum bidding price, and the deadline for bidding. Bidders can place their bids using the placeBidForAssetInAuction function.

## Testing
The smart contract can be tested using Ethereum development frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat. Write test cases to verify the functionality of each contract and ensure that the expected behavior is met.
